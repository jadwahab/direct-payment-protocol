  description: A protocol for communication between a payment host (usually either a
    beneficiary, a payment processor, or simply the recipient's wallet) and their
    customer (the sender of the funds), enabling both a better customer
    experience, simpler wallet infrastructure, more advanced features such as
    multiple outputs, and better security against man-in-the-middle attacks on
    the payment process.
